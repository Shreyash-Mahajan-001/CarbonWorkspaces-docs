## What is __Carbon Workspace__?
Our team understands the everyday life of teenagers. To achieve success during your teenage years, you need to balance everything more accurately and effectively.
It's important to create a schedule, plan your projects, manage your due dates, take notes efficiently, collaborate with your friends on incredible ideas, and much more.
But why would you use different applications for all these needs? With all these features, we've made your life easier.

## How Carbon workspaces works?
Carbon workspace is a multi-manager application for all your needs. Once you download the application and `sign in` to your account, you can surf freely without worrying about your meetings, your schedules, anything. You just hop on and enjoy! We'll take care of your ideas and work.

## Why should I use that?
There are a lot of things to manage as a teenager and as a working professional at the same time. You can instead create your own workspace where you have full control over how the workspace looks and functions.
Taking notes is easy with us. Time Management is something that we have already figured out!
For all those of us who work professionally, carbon makes life a lot easier in many ways.

## Why is Carbon better than others?
Today, the market has a lot of multi-managing applications, but they are expensive. As we care for our teenage friends and our hard-working professionals, we have made it free. You can get nearly all of the features for `NO COST`. Another thing that makes carbon different and special for others is your privacy and security! When you enter your workplace, you're completely safe from outsiders and malicious people. Carbon does not play with your private data or let others access it.

## What am I getting when I install Carbon?
Carbon provides you with 50GB of Cloud storage so that you don't have to struggle with the problem of disk space. Once you create your account, you will receive your Cloud storage, which you can expand as you wish. We offer a custom theme section so that you will be comfortable with the vibe. Carbon never steals or saves your data for self-use so you're protected all the way along with End-To-End Encryption. 
bon doesn't take a lot of disk space because it's a cloud-based program, so your RAM will not burn out in flames if you want to multitask with it. In consideration of the situation of our friends [you guys!] we have kept it as clean as possible so that you can download and run it directly without having to watch any funny tutorials.
